# Water Quality Monitoring (WQM)

## Overview

The Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) platform is designed to raise awareness about the importance of clean water and promote sustainable practices for managing water resources. Our mission is to ensure that everyone has access to safe and clean drinking water, as well as proper sanitation facilities. This project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

## Features

- Information on water quality and common water pollutants

- Methods to protect water resources

- Complaint submission and management system

- Dashboard for administrators to manage and respond to complaints

- Visualization of complaint statuses with a pie chart

## SDG 6 Alignment

The WQM platform supports Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) by providing tools and resources to improve water quality and promote sustainable water monitoring practices. Through our complaint management system, we address water quality issues promptly, contributing to the goal of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

## System Thinking

We applied systems thinking to analyze the intricate interactions involved in water quality monitoring. Breaking down the problem into smaller components enabled us to pinpoint crucial areas where intervention and enhancement were needed.
