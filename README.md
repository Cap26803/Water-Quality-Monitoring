# Water Quality Monitoring (WQM)

## Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a Complaint Management System to streamline the process of handling citizen grievances for a city administration. Through a userfriendly web application interface, citizens can submit complaints regarding issues such as water leakage and contamination.

## Objectives
• To develop a platform for reporting water quality complaints.
• To implement a system to manage and visualize submissions.

## SDG 6 Alignment

The WQM platform supports Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) by providing tools and resources to improve water quality and promote sustainable water monitoring practices. Through our complaint management system, we address water quality issues promptly, contributing to the goal of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

### SDG Goal 6:
![SDG 6](https://github.com/Cap26803/Water-Quality-Monitoring/assets/106472393/532d36d6-e216-4515-bd12-5fa18fcb29fe)

#### Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
• Target 6.1: By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.
• Indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services.

## System Thinking

We applied systems thinking to analyze the intricate interactions involved in water quality monitoring. Breaking down the problem into smaller components enabled us to pinpoint crucial areas where intervention and enhancement were needed.
